# List of Personal Projects by Danny Le Kim

Herein lies a list of Personal Projects that I would like to get through over the course of the 2018 year or later on. Anytime I have a cool idea that I want to eventually get through, I'll backlog it here. 

Without further ado, here's the list: 

- Team Organizer (Kantasky) in a MEAN Stack, Kotlin and Electron (**IN PROGRESS**) 
- Brutalist Web Messaging Application similar to https://brutal.chat/ in either Ruby/Node and a front-end stack of React. Debatable back-end stack: Java, Erlang, Go, Django. Possible to also do this in Kotlin/Electron  
  - use ML machine learning API to classify texts and make stats off it or have filters? Something in that vein 
- Fitness League Application for Mobile, android specific. Written in Android studio, back-end either in Ruby or Java/C# 
- Personal Website for UX Designs, Blogs dannylekim.me
- Personal Website for Projects and Resume dannylekim.com
- Web Application For Learning Data Structures and Algorithms in a step by step manner. Any stack. Better if also mobile. 
- Mobile/Desktop Application for music (Launch Pad) 
- Younity The Formful Game, written in Unity C# 
- Webcrawler 
- a mahine learning project (Public APIs are actually really cool) 
- a project using Spring Framework and Java
- theTechStack (a website that allows you to choose what your sources of information is and allows you to format them into a viewable, easily digestable layout specifically for technology) 
- music map: draw using certain brushes that have certain sounds and depending on how you draw will give a song. 
You could have ML decide the mood, and decide on a chord progression, and be able to export the score
- Based on a music preference/db training set, speculates a progression/melody that you start 

Technologies that I eventually want to be able to use: 

React, Vue, Ruby/Ruby on Rails, Kotlin, Electron, Unity (better)
